# Real Time Bus Tracker
<img src="RTBT.png" width="300"/>

## Description
This exercise uses an API to source real-time bus data from the Boston Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). When loaded to your browser, the MBTA is queried every 15 seconds to pull down current data for all buses on route 1; a bus route between the MIT campus and Harvard campus. The location of the buses are displayed live on a map by capturing the latitude and longitude data and creating a visual representation of those coordinates (i.e. blue and red bus icons) within a mapping platform. The blue bus icon denotes a bus traveling toward the MIT campus and a red bus icon denotes a bus traveling toward the Harvard campus.
